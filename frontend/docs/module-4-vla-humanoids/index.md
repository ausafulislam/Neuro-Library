# Module 4: VLA & Humanoids (Weeks 11-13)

## Overview

This final module covers Vision-Language-Action (VLA) systems and humanoid robot development. You'll learn to integrate perception, language understanding, and action planning to create sophisticated humanoid robots capable of complex interactions with humans and environments.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand Vision-Language-Action (VLA) system architectures
- Develop humanoid robot manipulation and grasping capabilities
- Implement human-robot interaction systems
- Create conversational robotics applications
- Design and implement a capstone autonomous humanoid project

## Prerequisites

- Completion of Modules 1, 2, and 3
- Understanding of computer vision and natural language processing
- Knowledge of advanced robotics concepts

## Module Structure

This module is divided into 5 chapters that build upon each other:

1. [Humanoid Robot Development](./chapter-1-humanoid-robot-development.md)
2. [Manipulation and Grasping](./chapter-2-manipulation-grasping.md)
3. [Human-Robot Interaction](./chapter-3-human-robot-interaction.md)
4. [Conversational Robotics](./chapter-4-conversational-robotics.md)
5. [Capstone: Autonomous Humanoid](./chapter-5-capstone-autonomous-humanoid.md)

## Duration

This module should take approximately 30-35 hours to complete, spread across Weeks 11-13 of the curriculum.

## Exercises

1. Design a humanoid robot kinematic model
2. Implement grasping algorithms for manipulation
3. Create a human-robot interaction interface
4. Develop a conversational agent for robotics
5. Integrate all components in a capstone project
