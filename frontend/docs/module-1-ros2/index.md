# Module 1: ROS 2 (Weeks 3-5)

## Overview

This module introduces the Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2), a flexible framework for writing robot software. You'll learn the fundamentals of ROS 2 architecture, including nodes, topics, services, and actions, which form the foundation for all subsequent modules.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the basic concepts of ROS 2
- Learn about nodes, topics, services, and actions
- Set up your first ROS 2 workspace
- Create and run simple ROS 2 packages
- Implement communication patterns between ROS 2 nodes

## Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of Linux command line
- Familiarity with Python programming
- Completion of Introduction module

## Module Structure

This module is divided into 5 chapters that build upon each other:

1. [Introduction to ROS 2](./chapter-1-introduction-to-ros2.md)
2. [Nodes and Topics](./chapter-2-nodes-and-topics.md)
3. [Services, Actions, and Parameters](./chapter-3-services-actions-parameters.md)
4. [URDF Robot Modeling](./chapter-4-urdf-robot-modeling.md)
5. [Launch Files and Package Management](./chapter-5-launch-files-package-management.md)

## Duration

This module should take approximately 20-25 hours to complete, spread across Weeks 3-5 of the curriculum.

## Exercises

1. Set up a ROS 2 workspace
2. Create your first ROS 2 package
3. Implement a simple publisher-subscriber system
