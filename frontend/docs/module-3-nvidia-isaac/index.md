# Module 3: NVIDIA Isaac (Weeks 8-10)

## Overview

This module focuses on NVIDIA Isaac, a comprehensive robotics platform that leverages hardware acceleration for advanced robotics applications. You'll learn about hardware-accelerated SLAM, navigation, AI-powered perception, and reinforcement learning techniques for Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the NVIDIA Isaac ecosystem and its components
- Implement hardware-accelerated Visual SLAM (VSLAM)
- Design navigation and path planning systems
- Apply AI-powered perception techniques
- Implement reinforcement learning for robotics

## Prerequisites

- Completion of Modules 1 and 2
- Understanding of computer vision fundamentals
- Basic knowledge of machine learning concepts

## Module Structure

This module is divided into 5 chapters that build upon each other:

1. [Isaac Sim Overview](./chapter-1-isaac-sim-overview.md)
2. [Hardware-Accelerated VSLAM](./chapter-2-hardware-accelerated-vslam.md)
3. [Navigation and Path Planning](./chapter-3-navigation-path-planning.md)
4. [AI-Powered Perception](./chapter-4-ai-powered-perception.md)
5. [Reinforcement Learning](./chapter-5-reinforcement-learning.md)

## Duration

This module should take approximately 25-30 hours to complete, spread across Weeks 8-10 of the curriculum.
