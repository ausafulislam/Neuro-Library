# Module 2: Digital Twin (Weeks 6-7)

## Overview

This module covers the creation and simulation of digital twins using Gazebo and Unity. You'll learn how to create high-fidelity simulations of physical robots and environments, which are essential for testing and development in Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the concept of digital twins and their applications
- Learn to create simulation environments in Gazebo
- Implement physics simulation with realistic parameters
- Design sensor simulation for virtual robots
- Create high-fidelity rendering for visualization

## Prerequisites

- Completion of Module 1 (ROS 2)
- Basic understanding of 3D modeling concepts
- Familiarity with simulation concepts

## Module Structure

This module is divided into 4 chapters that build upon each other:

1. [Introduction to Gazebo and Unity](./chapter-1-introduction-gazebo-unity.md)
2. [Physics Simulation](./chapter-2-physics-simulation.md)
3. [Sensor Simulation](./chapter-3-sensor-simulation.md)
4. [High-Fidelity Rendering](./chapter-4-high-fidelity-rendering.md)

## Duration

This module should take approximately 15-20 hours to complete, spread across Weeks 6-7 of the curriculum.

## Exercises

1. Create a simple robot model in Gazebo
2. Implement basic physics simulation
3. Add sensors to your simulated robot
4. Optimize rendering for performance
